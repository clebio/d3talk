# A data-visualization of Meetup info using D3
## Overview
This is an extension of the 'egovis' slide from [Mike Dewar's talk on D3][dcon]. We use the [Meetup API][meet] and Mike Bostock's [D3 library][d3]. 

## From Mike's github [repo][dewar]: 
  a talk aimed to try and get data scientists over that first hump of d3's learing curve and into the beautiful vista beyond...

  The code for the slide mechanics was written by Mike Bostock in d3! The data is from meetup.com's public API.

  In order to actually run through talk, clone this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000.
